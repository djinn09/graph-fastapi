# This code will create and maintain at least 5 websocket connections with Neptune, and use them to run queries concurrently. Each connection will have a connection time of 15 minutes, after which it will be closed and replaced by a new connection. If there are more requests than available connections, it will create new connections up to 20. If there are less requests than available connections, it will close some connections until there are only 5 left.

# I hope this helps you understand how to use Amazon Neptune and FastAPI with connection pooling. If you have any other questions, please let me know. ðŸ˜Š
